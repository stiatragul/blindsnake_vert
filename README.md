# Repository for "Uncovering the drivers of vertebra number variation in Australian blindsnakes"

---

These data scripts were used to perform analyses included in the research paper "Uncovering the drivers of vertebra number variation in Australian blindsnakes" in The Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society.

## Data structure

Contents in the data folder is archived as a zip and can be downloaded from Zenodo (for all versions see https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.15186327). Once you unzip the zipped files, you will see:

/data/read-only/ - raw measurements from different specimens

/data/script_generated_data/ - A combination of processed data needed to run the analyses. Headshape and body shape data are generated from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13743462.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13743462)

/data/x-ray/ - files for plotting vertebral profile

/data/radiograph.zip - zip archive with all X-ray images

## Code/Software

All scripts can be run in R Statistical Environment. Scripts should be run in order to create necessary files that will be saved in /data/script_generated_data/ for further scripts.Â
