# Introduction

Blindsnakes are 

Scolecophidians comprise XXX species of snakes with highly specialised phenotypes for a strictly fossorial life-style [@mirallesMolecular2018].

Although all blindsnakes are fossorial, body size and shape vary significantly among species (Tiatragul et al. unpublished; @shineNatural1990;@webbPreysize1993;@webbDietary2001;@ehmannFamily1993). Leptophlopids are generally thought to be more narrow and long compared to typhlopids, which are wider and more robust for a given snout-vent length [@herrelBurrowing2021]. These differences in body size and proportions determine how much push force the snakes can generate when burrowing. 

Their morphological differences led to the idea that leptyphlopids generally use existing burrows while typhlopids create their own burrow. 

Compared to other snakes, the vertebral column of fossorial snakes tend to feature a much higher proportion of pre- than post-cloacal segments [@pollyTesting2001]. This is reflected in the relative short tails of blindsnakes (CITE). 

The Australian blindsnake radiation comprise 47 described species [@tiatragulAustralia2023] with considerably diverse morphology from narrow-and-long (aspect ratio >= 100) to robust-and-wide (aspect ratio < 60). 

In this study, we investigate the interspecific variation in the number of vertebrae to test the hypothesis that changes in developmental patterns underpin the evolution of different body shapes in Australian typhlopid snakes. 

Specifically, we test two predictions:
(1) narrow-and-long species develop from postnatal ontogenetic changes where vertebral numbers are not significantly different between narrow-and-long species compared to wide-and-robust species; but are elongated. 
(2) Narrow-and-long blindsnakes develop via changes in the embryonic and postnatal stages where narrow-and-long species have greater number of vertebrae than wide-and-robust species. 

To test these predictions, we quantified the number of pre- and post-clocal vertebra across 37 species of Australian blindsnakes. 

# Material and Methods

## Sampling

We examined 341 specimens representing 44 lineages *Anilios* blindsnakes including 42/47 formally described species [@uetzQuarter2021]. Our sample size per species ranged from 1 to 25 specimens (median=7 specimens). We sourced specimens from South Australian Museum (SAMA), Western Australian Museum (WAM), Queensland Museum (QM), Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT), and a private collection. Where possible, we chose relatively large non-fragile specimens from both males and females with well-preserved heads for X-ray. Sex for each specimen were determined by inspecting the gonads, or assigned based on relative tail lengths folowing (Tiatragul et al. unpublished). 

## Phylogeny

We extracted 37 lineages of Australian blindsnakes from the time-calibrated phylogeny of Australian blindsnakes and outgroups presented in [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. The subset phylogeny represents 35/47 formally described species of _Anilios_ along with two additional genetically distinct lineages: one eastern population of "_A. grypus_" and one eastern population of "_A. ligatus_" [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. This phylogeny was inferred using the shortcut coalescent method in ASTRAL III [@zhangASTRALIIIPolynomialTime2018] based on 4930 maximum likelihood gene trees estimated using IQTREE [@minhIQTREE2020]. Divergence dating was estimated using MCMCTree from the PAML package [@yangPAML2007] based on 27 squamate reptile fossil calibrations [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. 

## Morphological data 

We collected body size measurements and vertebral counts from museum specimens examined. To quantify body size and body width ratios, we measured snout-to-vent length (SVL), tail lengths (TL) and midbody diameter (MBD). We measured SVL and TL by stretching the specimen along a ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm. For MBD, we used a digital vernier calliper (ABS Coolant Proof Caliper, Mitutoyo, Japan) to the nearest 0.1 mm. Total body length (TBL) is the sum of SVL + TL. 
<!-- To obtain  mean body shape ratios [@mosimannSize1970] for each species, we divided each MBD by SVL and log-transformed for further analyses. -->

To obtain vertebral counts, we X-ray scanned the specimens at various institutions including: LX-60 (Faxitron, IL, USA) at the University of Adelaide Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (n=87), Thermo Kevex PXS5-927EA Microfocus source (Waltham, MA, USA) with a LTX-1717 Digital Flat Panel Detector (Kodex Inc, NJ, USA) at the Western Australian Museum (n=129), HeliScan MicroCT system at the National Laboratory for X-Ray Micro Computed Tomography (CTLab) based at the Australian National University (ANU) (n=90), and Queensland X-Ray (n=35). 

<!-- Resolution for ANU CTLab is calculated by lenth / pixel * 1000 -->

We used the Fiji distribution of ImageJ2 [@schindelinFiji2012] to digitally visualise X-ray images and counted the number of vertebrae using Cell Counter module. Pre- and post-cloacal vertebrae were distinguished based on vertebral morphology [@szyndlarIllustrated2023]. Additionally, we quantified intracolumnar length of each vertebrae for three species representing narrow-and-wide phenotypes *A. grypus*, wide-and-robust phenotypes (*A. pinguis*), and intermediate phenotypes (*A. centralis*). Following @sherrattMacroevolution2022 we used the 'multipoint tool' in ImageJ2 to place landmarks medially along the vertebral column at the anterior limit of the centrum of each vertebra. We then calculated the inter-landmark distances by applying the Pythagorean theorem between sequential landmark coordinates in R. Measurements were repeated three times to account for measurement errors. 


<!-- ## Environmental data  -->
<!-- NEED TO PUT IN THE CORRECT VALUES HERE -->
<!-- We used the Australian blindsnake occurrence records presented in (Tiatragul et al. unpublished). These records were compiled from museum databases and verified human observations from Atlas of the Living Australia (ALA). A total of XXXX records (min = , median = , max = , median per species) representing XX species of Australian *Anilios* for our analyses.

We selected soil bulk density, annual mean temperature, and aridity index as the most biologically relevant data to describe blindsnake niches. 
Soil bulk density measures the penetrability of soil, which is relevant for strictly fossorial reptiles [camaitiMacroecological2022]. Bulk density is calculated by taking the weight of dry soil divided by the total soil volume (g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Values > 1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> tend to restrict root growth, while loose soil have densities < 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> [@mckenzieSoil2002]. Mean annual temperature serves as a climate proxy and is commonly used to describe niche for squamate reptiles [@coxEvolutionary2015;@pieEvolution2017;@wiensDiversity2013]. Finally, aridity index reflects precipitation availability over atmospheric water demand and is categorised as follows: hyper arid, < 0.03; arid, 0.03 – 0.2; semi-arid, 0.2-0.5; dry sub-humid, 0.5 – 0.65; humid, >0.65 [@zomerVersion2022]. 
From raster files that contained modelled approximations at the resolution of 3 arc-seconds, we extracted soil bulk density values between 0 — 5cm depth from [CSIRO Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia](https://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/index.html), mean annual temperature from WorldClim v.2 [@fickWorldClim2017], and aridity index from @zomerVersion2022 for each georeferenced record using the "extract" function in the R package `raster` v.3.6-3 [@hijmansRaster2022]. We then calculated the maximum soil bulk density, mean annual temperature, and mean aridity index for each species. Correlation analyses revealed that none of the background environmental variables were strongly correlated (Pearson's *r* < |0.75|).

## Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were performed in R v.4.31 [@rcoreteamLanguage2023]. To test for evolutionary correlations between the number of vertebrae and body size and proportions, we used phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regression under a model of Browninan motion implemented in `geomorph` v.4.0.6 [@adamsGeomorph2023]. First, we tested for pleomerism [@lindseyPleomerism1975] across 37 species of *Anilios* blindsnakes. 
We did this by testing whether the total number of vertebrae positively correlate with body size when regressing the maximum number of total vertebrae against maximum total body length from Tiatragul et al. (unpublished). Then, we test whether the vertebrae to body length ratio is related to maximum aspect ratio, defined by total body length / body width, also from Tiatragul et al. (unpublished) data. 

# Results

Total number of vertebrae varies among the 39 species of Australo-Papuan blindsnakes in this study (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-variation-totalvert)), ranging from 146 in *A. tovelli* to 400 in *A. grypus* ($$Table 1$$). 

We found a weakly positive but non statistically significant relationship between maximum number of total vertebrae and maximum SVL (PGLS, slope=0.28, y=256, R^2^=0.02, F=0.72, Z=0.29, P=0.42), indicating an absence of pleomerism in Australian blindsnakes (Fig. \@ref(fig: fig-tbl-vert)). 

However, we found that vertebrae ratio is postively correlated with aspect ratio (PGLS, slope=-0.0048, y=0.73, R^2^=0.17, F=7.09,, Z=2.2, P=0.011), indicating that species that are more narrow-and-wide usually have greater total vertebrae to total length ratios than species that are wide-and-robust (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-vert-width-ratios)).

<!-- ### Variation in vertebrae number -->




Closely related species tend to have similar number of total vertebrae. 
Males tend to have greater number of postcloacal vertebrae 



<!-- FIGURE 1 -->




There is a statistically significant correlation between vertebrae ratio and fineness of the body. Species that have more vertebrae per length (vertebrae ratio > 1) are usually more fine, whereas more robust species have lower number of vertebrae. 



# Discussion





## Miscellaneous 
Traditionally, ventral scale counts have been used as a proxy for vertebral number as they correlate for most alethinophidian snakes [@alexanderPattern1966]. We found that this is (not) the case in blindsnakes.
