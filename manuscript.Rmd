# Introduction

Blindsnakes are 

Scolecophidians comprise XXX species of snakes with highly specialised phenotypes for a strictly fossorial life-style [@mirallesMolecular2018].

Although all blindsnakes are fossorial, body size and shape vary significantly among species (Tiatragul et al. unpublished; @shineNatural1990;@webbPreysize1993;@webbDietary2001;@ehmannFamily1993). Leptophlopids are generally thought to be more narrow and long compared to typhlopids, which are wider and more robust for a given snout-vent length [@herrelBurrowing2021]. These differences in body size and proportions determine how much push force the snakes can generate when burrowing. 

Their morphological differences led to the idea that leptyphlopids generally use existing burrows while typhlopids create their own burrow. 

Compared to other snakes, the vertebral column of fossorial snakes tend to feature a much higher proportion of pre- than post-cloacal segments [@pollyTesting2001]. This is reflected in the relatively short tails of blindsnakes (CITE). 

The Australian blindsnake radiation comprise 47 described species [@tiatragulAustralia2023] with considerably diverse morphology from narrow-and-long (aspect ratio >= 100) to robust-and-wide (aspect ratio < 60). 

In this study, we investigate the prevalence of pleomerism among Australian blindsnakes and test hypotheses that deviations from pleomerism may be explained by different body shapes or other ecological factors among Australian typhlopid snakes. The specific questions we addressed are: 

1. How prevalent is pleomerism among blindsnakes?

2. Can deviations from pleomerism be explained by body shape in a genus of Australian blindsnakes?

3. Does vertebral ratio vary with soil compactness or mean annual temperature?

<!-- Specifically, we test two predictions: -->
<!-- (1) narrow-and-long species develop from postnatal ontogenetic changes where vertebral numbers are not significantly different between narrow-and-long species compared to wide-and-robust species.  -->
<!-- (2) Narrow-and-long blindsnakes develop via changes in the embryonic and postnatal stages where narrow-and-long species have greater number of vertebrae than wide-and-robust species.  -->

To answer these questions we gathered data on the number of vertebrae across XX species of Australian blindsnakes. 

# Material and Methods

## Sampling

We examined 341 specimens representing 44 lineages *Anilios* blindsnakes including 42/47 formally described species [@uetzQuarter2021]. Our sample size per species ranged from 1 to 25 specimens (median=7 specimens). We sourced specimens from South Australian Museum (SAMA), Western Australian Museum (WAM), Queensland Museum (QM), Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT), and a private collection. Where possible, we chose relatively large non-fragile specimens from both males and females with well-preserved heads for X-ray. Sex for each specimen were determined by inspecting the gonads, or assigned based on relative tail lengths folowing (Tiatragul et al. unpublished). 

## Phylogeny

We extracted 37 lineages of Australian blindsnakes from the time-calibrated phylogeny of Australian blindsnakes and outgroups presented in [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. The subset phylogeny represents 35/47 formally described species of _Anilios_ along with two additional genetically distinct lineages: one eastern population of "_A. grypus_" and one eastern population of "_A. ligatus_" [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. This phylogeny was inferred using the shortcut coalescent method in ASTRAL III [@zhangASTRALIIIPolynomialTime2018] based on 4930 maximum likelihood gene trees estimated using IQTREE [@minhIQTREE2020]. Divergence dating was estimated using MCMCTree from the PAML package [@yangPAML2007] based on 27 squamate reptile fossil calibrations [@tiatragulAustralia2023]. This phylogeny is was used for all phylogenetic comparative analyses. 

## Morphological data 

We collected body size measurements and vertebral counts from museum specimens examined. To quantify body size and body width ratios, we measured snout-to-vent length (SVL), tail lengths (TL) and midbody diameter (MBD). We measured SVL and TL by stretching the specimen along a ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm. For MBD, we used a digital vernier calliper (ABS Coolant Proof Caliper, Mitutoyo, Japan) to the nearest 0.1 mm. Total body length (TBL) is the sum of SVL + TL. 
<!-- To obtain  mean body shape ratios [@mosimannSize1970] for each species, we divided each MBD by SVL and log-transformed for further analyses. -->

To obtain vertebral counts, we X-ray scanned the specimens at various institutions including: LX-60 (Faxitron, IL, USA) at the University of Adelaide Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (n=87), Thermo Kevex PXS5-927EA Microfocus source (Waltham, MA, USA) with a LTX-1717 Digital Flat Panel Detector (Kodex Inc, NJ, USA) at the Western Australian Museum (n=129), HeliScan MicroCT system at the National Laboratory for X-Ray Micro Computed Tomography (CTLab) based at the Australian National University (ANU) (n=90), and Queensland X-Ray (n=35). 

<!-- Resolution for ANU CTLab is calculated by lenth / pixel * 1000 -->

We used the Fiji distribution of ImageJ2 [@schindelinFiji2012] to digitally visualise X-ray images and counted the number of vertebrae using Cell Counter module. Pre- and post-cloacal vertebrae were distinguished based on vertebral morphology [@szyndlarIllustrated2023]. Additionally, we quantified intracolumnar length of each vertebrae for three species representing narrow-and-wide phenotypes *A. grypus*, wide-and-robust phenotypes (*A. pinguis*), and intermediate phenotypes (*A. centralis*). Following @sherrattMacroevolution2022 we used the 'multipoint tool' in ImageJ2 to place landmarks medially along the vertebral column at the anterior limit of the centrum of each vertebra. We then calculated the inter-landmark distances by applying the Pythagorean theorem between sequential landmark coordinates in R. Measurements were repeated three times to account for measurement errors. 


## Environmental data 
<!-- NEED TO PUT IN THE CORRECT VALUES HERE -->

We used the Australian blindsnake occurrence records presented in (Tiatragul et al. unpublished). These records were compiled from museum databases and verified human observations from Atlas of the Living Australia (ALA). A total of XXXX records (min = , median = , max = , median per species) representing XX species of Australian *Anilios* for our analyses.

We selected soil bulk density, annual mean temperature, and aridity index as the most biologically relevant data to describe blindsnake niches. 
Soil bulk density measures the penetrability of soil, which is relevant for strictly fossorial reptiles [camaitiMacroecological2022]. Bulk density is calculated by taking the weight of dry soil divided by the total soil volume (g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Values > 1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> tend to restrict root growth, while loose soil have densities < 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> [@mckenzieSoil2002]. Mean annual temperature serves as a climate proxy and is commonly used to describe niche for squamate reptiles [@coxEvolutionary2015;@pieEvolution2017;@wiensDiversity2013]. Finally, aridity index reflects precipitation availability over atmospheric water demand and is categorised as follows: hyper arid, < 0.03; arid, 0.03 – 0.2; semi-arid, 0.2-0.5; dry sub-humid, 0.5 – 0.65; humid, >0.65 [@zomerVersion2022]. 
From raster files that contained modelled approximations at the resolution of 3 arc-seconds, we extracted soil bulk density values between 0 — 5cm depth from [CSIRO Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia](https://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/index.html), mean annual temperature from WorldClim v.2 [@fickWorldClim2017], and aridity index from @zomerVersion2022 for each georeferenced record using the "extract" function in the R package `raster` v.3.6-3 [@hijmansRaster2022]. We then calculated the maximum soil bulk density, mean annual temperature, and mean aridity index for each species. Correlation analyses revealed that none of the background environmental variables were strongly correlated (Pearson's *r* < |0.75|). 
 -->

## Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were performed in R v.4.31 [@rcoreteamLanguage2023]. To test for evolutionary correlations between the number of vertebrae and body size and proportions, we used phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regression under a model of Browninan motion implemented in `geomorph` v.4.0.6 [@adamsGeomorph2023]. First, we tested for pleomerism [@lindseyPleomerism1975] across 37 species of *Anilios* blindsnakes. 
We did this by testing whether the total number of vertebrae positively correlate with body size when regressing the maximum number of total vertebrae against maximum total body length from Tiatragul et al. (unpublished). Next, we test whether the vertebrae to body length ratio is related to maximum aspect ratio, defined by total body length / body width, also from Tiatragul et al. (unpublished) data. Finally, we tested if variation in vertebral ratio can be explained by mean annual temperature.



# Results

### Prevalence of pleomerism among blindsnakes

Total number of vertebrae varies among the 39 species of Australo-Papuan blindsnakes in this study (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-variation-totalvert)), ranging from 146 in *A. tovelli* to 400 in *A. grypus* ($$Table 1$$).

The boxplot represent the distribution of the data, with vertical inside representing the median. The extent of the box represent the lower (left) and upper (right) quartile, with the whiskers showing 1.5 times the interquartile range.

```

For the Australian blindsnakes, we found a weakly positive but non statistically significant relationship between maximum number of total vertebrae and maximum SVL (PGLS, slope=0.28, y=256, R^2^=0.02, F=0.72, Z=0.29, P=0.42), indicating an absence of pleomerism in Australian blindsnakes (Fig. \@ref(fig: fig-tbl-vert)). This suggest that maximum length is acheived by elongating each vertebrae rather than by adding additional vertebrae

### Relationship between vertebrae ratio and body shape
However, we found that vertebrae ratio is postively correlated with aspect ratio (PGLS, slope=-0.0048, y=0.73, R^2^=0.17, F=7.09,, Z=2.2, P=0.011), indicating that species that are more narrow-and-wide usually have greater total vertebrae to total length ratios than species that are wide-and-robust (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-vert-width-ratios)). This is consistent with colubrids and viperids, where species that are more elongated tend to have greater number of vertebrae than stouter ones [@lindellEvolution1994].

### Correlation with mean annual temperature among Australian blindsnakes

We found a positive relationship between vertebrae ratio and species mean annual temperature (PGLS, slope=0.038, y=0.19, R^2^=0.21, F=9.58,, Z=2.32, P=0.009), indicating species that have greater amount of vertebrae for body size are generally found in places that are warmer.

# Discussion

Summary about what the paper found

Not so surprising but shows that pleomerism does not explain variation in body size in this continental radiation of blindsnakes. Only real giant taxa like *Rhinotyphlops* and *Afrotyphlops* tend to break the rule. However, when fitted in our PGLS, we found that even they are not exceptional???

Body shape varied with number of vertebrae in similar ways as previously reported in vipers and colubrids [@lindellEvolution1994]. We can speculate that species that are narrow-and-long may be using pre-existing burrows rather than digging their own burrow. Narrow-and-wide phenotypes are common among Leptotyphlopidae, which are thought to use existing burrows rather than dig their own burrow [@herrelBurrowing2021]. The Australian group is quite exceptional because within the same genus, their is great variation in aspect ratio so species that evolved more narrow-and-long bodies may be converging on the lifestyle with other blindsnakes that have this narrow-and-long phenotype. On the other hand, large robust-and-wide species are expected to be able to generate much more force and make their own burrows. A previous study (Tiatragul et al. unpublished) found that species that robust-and-wide species tend to occupy areas in Australia that have easier to penetrate soil compared to narrow-and-long species that tend to occupy areas with more difficult to penetrate soil. However, more detailed microhabitat observations is required to determine if body shape is related to the environment in which they burrow. 


Mean annual temperature was a significant predictor of vertebrae ratio. Temperature could be a proxy for several ecological factors such ...
Common garden experiments for different species of snakes can tell us if incubation temperature and thus rate of development influences number of vertebrae. We would expect higher temperature to accelerate development (CITE anolis papers, turtles, etc), so less time for embryonic development. 

## Miscellaneous 
Traditionally, ventral scale counts have been used as a proxy for vertebral number as they correlate for most alethinophidian snakes [@alexanderPattern1966]. We found that this is (not) the case in blindsnakes. Blindsnakes are generally small enough to fit in an X-ray scanner so more people should do it.
